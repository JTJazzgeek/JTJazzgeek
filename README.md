- 👋 Hi, I’m @JTJazzgeek
- 👀 I think I have the ability to become a full stack developer, but I'd like to concentrate on being a back-end programmer for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but have experience in several programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING. This is the one area in which I feel I need the most experience.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at jazzgeek@aol.com.
